<p>Work? There is LinkedIn!<br>Code and projects? GitHub!<br>Videos? YouTube!<br>Trying to communicate your ideas to a
  mass of trolls? Facebook!</p>

<p>But there are a few things that cannot be found on these platforms that pushed me to open a website:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I would like to have something&nbsp;<strong>mine</strong>, that I
    can&nbsp;<strong>change</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>control</strong>. When you open any social media you are
    bombarded with information that you were not looking for. I would like a quiet space where you can browse just
    this content if you like it, or be bored to death and leave forever if you do not!</li>
  <li><strong>Aggregation!</strong>&nbsp;I am planning to start a YouTube channel, I have some projects on GitHub,
    some posts on Facebook that look more like a blog. All scattered around the web. Would it be nice to have
    everything organized in one place?</li>
  <li><strong>Learning something new!</strong>&nbsp;I am convinced that making websites is not a useless skill!</li>
</ul>

<p>Why not in Italian? Although it would be easier for me to write in my native language this would restrict the
  audience for the website and increase dramatically the number of horrible jokes and puns that I scatter around. I
  will consider translating some articles but the language is going to stay English.</p>
